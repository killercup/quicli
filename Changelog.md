[#45]: https://github.com/killercup/quicli/pull/45

### Changed

- Upgrade structopt to 0.2:
  - No need to add structopt to you dependencies anymore (just delete the line in the `Cargo.toml`)
  - Their handling of "occurrences of" parameters changed, so, for verbosity you now need to write:
    
    ```rust
    #[structopt(long = "verbosity", short = "v", parse(from_occurrences))]
    verbosity: u8,
    ```
